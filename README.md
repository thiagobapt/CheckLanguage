# Check Language
An interpreted language written in Typescript.

Experiment with Check Language in the [code sandbox](https://thiagobapt.github.io/CheckLanguage/)!

## Features and syntax

Currently, Check supports:
- Variable types:
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
- If Statements
- Else Statements
- While Loops
- For Loops
- Functions

### Variable declaration and assignement
Variables are declared like this:

`var name = 10;`

The keyword "var" is used to declare a variable.

To assign a new value to a variable, it's done like this:

`name = 20;`

Check also supports expression with parenthesis, so you can also do this:

`name = name * (10 + 20);`
